(Leetcode Problem) 

Given a m x n matrix mat and an integer k, return a matrix answer where each answer[i][j] is the sum of all elements mat[r][c] for:

i - k <= r <= i + k,
j - k <= c <= j + k, and
(r, c) is a valid position in the matrix.
 

Example 1:

Input: mat = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]], k = 1
Output: [[12,21,16],[27,45,33],[24,39,28]]
